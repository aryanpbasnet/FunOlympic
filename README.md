# FunOlympic Web Application

## Project Overview

**FunOlympic** is a web-based application developed as part of an **undergraduate academic assignment** for the Computer Systems Engineering program.
The project was created in response to a fictional scenario where the City of **Payris** hosts the **FunOlympic Games 2024**, requiring a digital platform to allow global audiences to register and access online broadcasts of Olympic events.

This application focuses on **user management, authentication, and role-based access**, delivering a functional prototype that meets the core system requirements defined by the assignment.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this project was to design and implement:

* An **online registration system** for public users
* A **secure login/logout mechanism**
* A **broadcast selection feature**
* An **admin panel** for managing users and system interactions

At this prototypical stage, **payment processing and financial security mechanisms were intentionally excluded**, as per assignment requirements.
